        <p>There is currently no scientific consensus on a global dataset for deforestation rates, and in many cases this lack of consensus extends to the national level.  We include multiple data sources on GFW Climate in the hopes of fostering transparency and understanding of data differences. </p>
        <h3>Gross tree cover loss</h3>
        <p>Estimates are based on Hansen et al. (2013) and subsequent annual updates available on Global Forest Watch. Hansen et al. use Landsat satellite imagery at 30 meter pixel resolution to measure the magnitude of annual tree cover loss, counting all tree cover or forest area lost without regard to regeneration or reforestation of natural forest. Tree cover is a proxy for forest cover, defined as all vegetation five meters or taller. On GFW Climate, a user can adjust the minimum tree canopy density threshold for what defines a forest at a value between 10% and 30%, and gross tree cover loss estimates will update accordingly to reflect the new forest definition.</p>
        <h3>Net forest conversion</h3>
        <p>Estimates are based on FAO’s Forest Resources Assessment 2015, which compiles country-level data on forest area that are self-reported by countries every five years using their own inventories, surveys and maps. Forests are defined based on national land use classifications, with a minimum threshold of 0.5 ha land area, trees over 5 meters and a 10% minimum canopy cover. Figures for net forest conversion are reported by subtracting the total natural forest cover reported for one reporting period from the previous reporting period.
        <strong>Whereas gross forest loss treats the loss term as categorically distinct from regeneration, net forest loss conflates the two.</strong>

        <h3>Other national deforestation data</h3>
        <p>Gross deforestation estimates for Brazil are from the System of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimates (SEEG), and estimates for the Amazon biome are consistent with INPE’s annual deforestation monitoring. Data for other countries reflect gross deforestation rates included in country

    </div>

    <div class='source_body'>
      <div class='source_summary'>
        <p>Carbon emissions from deforestation reflect the carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere as a result of forest biomass clearing, and country level estimates are commonly expressed in units of carbon (Tg) or carbon dioxide (Mt CO2). For tropical forested countries, most emission estimates are derived using IPCC Guidelines for Tier 1 accounting by multiplying an estimate of the area of deforestation by an estimate of the biomass carbon of the deforested area, and these are assumed to be “committed” emissions to the atmosphere. Carbon sequestration from growing vegetation after clearing is generally excluded from large-scale carbon assessments; this requires additional information on the fate of the cleared land, which is often lacking. Emissions from tropical organic (peat) soils in Southeast Asia are also either excluded or reported separately; estimates are available on GFW Climate as separate indicators.</p>
        <h3>Carbon emissions from gross tree cover loss</h3>
        <p>Estimates are based on the co-location of aboveground biomass carbon density values for the year 2000 with annual tree cover loss data from 2001 through 2014 at 30 m spatial resolution. Emissions associated with other carbon pools such as belowground biomass and soil carbon are excluded. Loss of biomass, like loss of tree cover, may occur for many reasons, including deforestation, fire, and logging within the course of sustainable forestry operations. For DRC, Indonesia and Malaysia, emissions are further disaggregated to approximate those from deforestation consistent with Zarin et al. (2015). On GFW Climate, a user can adjust the minimum tree canopy density threshold for what defines a forest at a value between 10% and 30%, and carbon emission estimates will update accordingly to reflect the new forest definition.</p>
        <h3>Carbon emissions from net forest conversion</h3>
        <p>Estimates are based on national estimates of net forest conversion and biomass carbon stock density, as reported by countries every five years to FAO’s Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) using their own inventories, surveys, and maps. Estimates of net forest conversion are used as a proxy for deforestation (Federici et al. 2015), and estimates of woody biomass carbon stock density are in most cases derived from the use of conversion factors to estimate total living biomass stocks from nationally reported wood volumes. A summary of source data used by countries in FAO reporting on forest biomass can be found <a href="/forest_change_data" target="_blank">here</a>. FRA data do not allow for quantification of gross area changes.</p>
        <h3>Carbon emissions from other national deforestation data</h3>
        <p>Carbon emission estimates for Brazil are from the System of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimates (SEEG). Data for other countries reflect annual carbon emission estimates included in country (Forest Reference Emission Level) submissions to the UNFCCC.</p>

        <p>The definition of the word “forest” differs from region to region and country to country based on different objectives such as management, land use, vegetation type, composition, and altitude. As such, there are over 800 definitions worldwide (Lund 2002). Here, we present two global sources of forest area data for the tropical countries included on GFW Climate.</p>
        <h3>Area with tree cover</h3>
        <p>“Percent tree cover” is defined as the density of tree canopy coverage of the land surface within a 30 m (0.09 ha) pixel. 30 x 30 meter pixels were aggregated to estimate the area of tree cover at the relevant scale of analysis (national, subnational, etc.). On GFW Climate, a user can adjust the minimum tree canopy density threshold for what defines a forest at a value between 10% and 30% and the area of tree cover will update accordingly to reflect the new forest definition.</p>
        <h3>Forest area</h3>
        <p>National forest area statistics for the year 2000 are reported by countries to the Food and Agriculture Organization every five years as part of their Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Forests are defined for these assessments based on national land use classifications, with a minimum threshold of 0.5 ha land area, trees over 5 meters and a 10% minimum canopy cover. A summary of source data used by countries in FAO reporting on forest area can be found <a href="/forest_change_data" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Carbon is stored in trees both above and below the soil, including stem, stump, branches, bark, seeds and leaves, and in live roots. Average biomass carbon density values, as estimated from forest inventories and/or spatially-explicit mapping products, can be used to estimate the total amount of carbon stored in trees within an area of interest by multiplying density values by the forest area under consideration at the relevant scale of analysis (national, subnational, or within specific areas of interest).</p>
        <h3>Satellite-based estimates/WHRC</h3>
        <p>The biomass density maps on GFW Climate were produced by Woods Hole Research Center at 30 x 30 m spatial resolution and are representative of the year 2000. Values for each pixel refer to the average woody live biomass of forests within the pixel, and can be used directly to estimate the total biomass carbon stock within the pixel. Biomass is assumed to be 50% carbon. Pixels are then aggregated to estimate total biomass carbon stocks at the relevant scale of analysis (national, subnational, or within specific areas of interest). Belowground biomass is calculated as 26% of aboveground biomass based on Mokany et al. (2006). On GFW Climate, a user can adjust the minimum tree canopy density threshold for what defines a forest at a value between 10% and 30%, and biomass carbon stock estimates will update accordingly to reflect the new forest definition.</p>
        <h3>FAO FRA 2015</h3>
        <p>Estimates of above- and belowground biomass carbon stocks in the year 2000 are based on FAO’s Forest Resource Assessment 2015, which compiles country-level data that are self-reported by countries every five years using their own inventories, surveys and maps.

        <p>Soil organic carbon is a major component of soil organic matter, which is derived from residual, decomposed plant and animal material. Natural factors, such as land cover, vegetation, topography and climate, as well as human factors, such as land use and management, can influence the amount of soil organic matter, and thus soil organic carbon, present in soils. Total soil organic carbon within an area of interest can be estimated by multiplying soil organic carbon density values by the amount of forest area at the relevant scale of analysis (national, subnational, or within specific areas of interest). On GFW Climate, a user can adjust the minimum tree canopy density threshold for what defines a forest at a value between 10% and 30% and soil organic carbon stock estimates will update accordingly to reflect the new forest definition.</p>
        <p>To calculate topsoil organic carbon (to 30 cm depth), we use data from the <a href="http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-database/HTML/index.html?sb=1" target="_blank">Harmonized World Soil Database</a> (HWSD), a compilation of four soil databases: the European Soil Database (ESDB), the 1:1 million soil map of China, various regional SOTER databases (SOTWIS Database), and the Soil Map of the World. The HWSD contains information on soil parameters, such as organic carbon, pH, water storage capacity, soil depth, total exchangeable nutrients and salinity. Soil carbon estimates, and soil information in general, have long been considered highly uncertain, and the HWSD makes major improvements by integrating existing regional and national soil information worldwide into a harmonized format. This dataset currently constitutes the best available spatially-explicit soil carbon data for most regions. The spatial resolution of the data is 1 km.</p>

        <p>The amount of carbon stored in soils to 30 cm depth in each 1 km pixel was calculated using inputs of percent carbon content, bulk density, and gravel volume. We use relative bulk density values except for Andosols and Histosols, which are typically overestimated by this method. Values are calculated for 0-30 cm depth. See more information on calculating SOC from the HWSD <a href="http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdb_archive/eusoils_docs/other/EUR25225.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Forested pixels within a given extent were summed to derive total carbon stored in soils.</p>

        <p>Demographic factors including population growth, population density, migration and urbanization all contribute to the complex relationship between human population trends and deforestation trends. Population growth is one of the most commonly cited indirect drivers of deforestation in many tropical forested countries, particularly in tropical Africa. </p>
        <p>Here, we display national data on urban and rural population growth (%/yr) as estimated by the United Nations, accessed through the World Bank’s World Development Indicators website.</p>

        <p>Development of agriculture and other human activities on peatlands requires drainage, which leads to
        increased CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from peat decomposition. Highly productive croplands, including plantations, will always be 100% drained (Hooijer et al. 2010).</p>
        <p>Here, we apply a Tier 1 methodology (IPCC 2014) to estimate annual CO2 emissions from peat drainage based on the area of overlap between mapped areas of large industrial plantations in 2013/2014 (Transparent World 2015) and mapped areas of peatlands (Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture 2011), and apply an emission factor of 15 t CO2 ha-1 yr-1, based on guidance provided in Equation 2.3 and Table 2.1 of IPCC (2014).</p>

        <p>Carbon is stored in trees both above and below the soil, including stem, stump, branches, bark, seeds and leaves, and in live roots. At the most fundamental level, all methodological approaches to measuring carbon in trees rely on the collection of reliable data within inventory plots on the ground, where typically the diameter at breast height (DBH) of individual trees are measured by field technicians and converted to tree biomass estimates using allometric equations. Due to methodological difficulties associated with measuring root biomass, applying a default root : shoot ratio is a core method for estimating belowground (root) biomass from the more easily measured aboveground biomass. Biomass of the forest understory is generally excluded from the aboveground biomass estimates in broadscale carbon accounting.</p>
        <h3>Satellite based estimate/WHRC</h3>
        <p>Estimates are derived from a 30 m resolution map of aboveground woody biomass density across the tropics, developed by Woods Hole Research Center using a combination of ground measurements, GLAS LiDAR waveform metrics and Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite imagery and products, elevation and other biophysical variables. Belowground biomass is calculated as 26% of aboveground biomass based on Mokany et al. (2006). On GFW Climate, a user can adjust the minimum tree canopy density threshold for what defines a forest at a value between 10% and 30%, and biomass carbon density estimates will update accordingly to reflect the new forest definition.</p>
        <h3>FAO FRA 2015</h3>
        <p>Estimates of above- and belowground biomass carbon density in the year 2000 are based on FAO’s Forest Resource Assessment 2015, which compiles country-level data that are self-reported by countries every five years using their own inventories, surveys and maps. Source data on biomass estimates from FAO country reports are summarized <a href="/biomass_data" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Soil organic carbon is a major component of soil organic matter, which is derived from residual, decomposed plant and animal material. Natural factors, such as land cover, vegetation, topography and climate, as well as human factors, such as land use and management, can influence the amount of soil organic matter, and thus soil organic carbon, present in soils. On GFW Climate, a user can adjust the minimum tree canopy density threshold for what defines a forest at a value between 10% and 30% and average carbon stored in soil per unit area will update accordingly to reflect the new forest definition.</p>
        <p>To calculate topsoil organic carbon (to 30 cm depth), we use data from the <a href="http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-database/HTML/index.html?sb=1" target="_blank">Harmonized World Soil Database</a> (HWSD), a compilation of four soil databases: the European Soil Database (ESDB), the 1:1 million soil map of China, various regional SOTER databases (SOTWIS Database), and the Soil Map of the World. The HWSD contains information on soil parameters, such as organic carbon, pH, water storage capacity, soil depth, total exchangeable nutrients and salinity. Soil carbon estimates, and soil information in general, have long been considered highly uncertain, and the HWSD makes major improvements by integrating existing regional and national soil information worldwide into a harmonized format. This dataset currently constitutes the best available spatially-explicit soil carbon data for most regions. The spatial resolution of the data is 1 km.</p>
        <p>The amount of carbon stored in soils to 30 cm depth was calculated using inputs of percent carbon content, bulk density, and gravel volume. We use relative bulk density values except for Andosols and Histosols, which are typically overestimated by this method. Values are calculated for 0-30 cm depth. See more information on calculating SOC from the HWSD <a href="http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdb_archive/eusoils_docs/other/EUR25225.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
