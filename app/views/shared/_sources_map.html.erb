          <p> “Managed forests” refers to areas allocated by a government for harvesting timber and other wood products in a public forest. Managed forests are distinct from wood fiber concessions, where tree plantations are established for the exclusive production of pulp and paper products. “Concession” is used as a general term for licenses, permits, or other contracts that confer rights to private companies to manage and extract timber and other wood products from public forests; terminology varies at the national level, however, and includes "forest permits," "tenures," "licenses," and other terms.</p>

          <p>This data set displays managed forest concessions as a single layer assembled by aggregating data for multiple countries. The data may come from government agencies, NGOs, or other organizations and varies by date and data sources.

          <p>This data set was created by Transparent World, with the support of Global Forest Watch. Many studies depicting forest cover and forest change cannot distinguish between natural forests and plantations. This data set attempts to distinguish tree plantations from natural forest for seven key countries: Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Indonesia, Liberia, Malaysia, and Peru.</p>

          <p>Given the variability of plantations and their spectral similarity to natural forests, this study used visual interpretations of satellite imagery, primarily <a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">Landsat</a>, supplemented by high resolution imagery (Google Maps, Bing Maps, or Digital Globe), where available, to locate plantations. Analysts hand-digitized plantation boundaries based on several key visual criteria, including texture, shape, color, and size.</p>

          <p>Each polygon is labelled with the plantation type and when possible, the species. A “gr” in front of the species name indicates a group of species, such as pines or fruit, where the individual species was not identifiable. The percentage of plantation coverage indicates a rough estimate of the prevalence of plantation within apolygon (as in the case of a mosaic). Types are defined as follows:</p>
          <p><ul class="bullets">
            <li><strong>Large industrial plantation:</strong> single plantation units larger than 100 hectares</li>
            <li><strong>Mosaic of medium-sized plantations:</strong> mosaic of plantation units < 100 hectares embedded within patches of other land use</li>
            <li><strong>Mosaic of small-sized plantations:</strong> mosaic of plantation units < 10 hectares embedded within patches of other land use.</li>
            <li><strong>Clearing/ very young plantation:</strong> bare ground with contextual clues suggesting it will become a plantations (shape or pattern of clearing, proximity to other plantations, distinctive road network, etc)</li>
          </ul></p>

            <dd>The world IFL map was created through visual interpretation of Landsat images by experts. The map may contain inaccuracies due to limitations in the spatial resolution of the imagery and lack of ancillary information about local land-use practices in some regions. In addition, the methodology assumes that fires in proximity to roads or other infrastructure may have been caused by humans, and therefore constitute a form of anthropogenic disturbance. This assumption could result in an underestimation of IFL extent in the boreal biome.</dd>

          <p>The <a href='http://intactforests.org/' target='_blank'>Intact Forest Landscapes</a> (IFL) data set identifies unbroken expanses of natural ecosystems within the zone of forest extent that show no signs of significant human activity and are large enough that all native biodiversity, including viable populations of wide-ranging species, could be maintained. To map IFL areas, a set of criteria was developed and designed to be globally applicable and easily replicable, the latter to allow for repeated assessments over time as well as verification. IFL areas were defined as unfragmented landscapes, at least 50,000 hectares in size, and with a minimum width of 10 kilometers. IFL areas were defined as unfragmented landscapes, at least 50,000 hectares in size, and with a minimum width of 10 kilometers. These were then mapped from Landsat imagery for the years 2000 and 2013.</p>

          <p>Changes in the extent of IFLs were identified within year 2000 IFL boundary using the global wall-to-wall Landsat image composite for year 2013 and the global forest cover loss dataset (Hansen et al., 2013). Areas identified as “reduction in extent” met the IFL criteria in 2000, but no longer met the criteria in 2013. The main causes of change were clearing for agriculture and tree plantations, industrial activity such as logging and mining, fragmentation due to infrastructure and new roads, and fires assumed to be caused by humans.</p>

          <p>This data can be used to assess forest intactness, alteration, and degradation at global and regional scales. More information about the data set and methodology is available on  <a href="http://www.intactforests.org">www.intactforests.org</a></p>

          <p>This data set shows the coverage of primary humid tropical forest in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the year 2000 at a 60 meter resolution. “Primary forest” is defined in this data set as mature humid tropical forest with greater than 60% canopy cover, and differs from “secondary forest” (regrowing forest with greater than 60% canopy cover) and “woodlands” (between 30% and 60% canopy cover). The authors created a composite of cloud-free Landsat imagery during the growing season of 2000 to conduct the analysis. They applied supervised bagged classification tree models to separate forest areas from non-forest based on training sites. Within forest areas, primary forests were separated from secondary forests and woodlands using supervised classification.

          <p>Soil is the second largest global carbon stock (after oceans) and is a significant component of the biosphere, delivering important ecosystem services. Soil organic carbon is a major component of soil organic matter, which is derived from residual, decomposed plant and animal material. Natural factors, such as land cover, vegetation, topography and climate, as well as man-made factors, such as land use and management, can influence the amount of soil organic matter, and thus soil organic carbon, present in soils.</p>
          <p>To calculate topsoil organic carbon, we use data from the <a href="http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-database/HTML/index.html?sb=1" target="_blank">Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD)</a>, a compilation of four soil databases: the European Soil Database (ESDB), the 1:1 million soil map of China, various regional SOTER databases (SOTWIS Database), and the Soil Map of the World. The HWSD contains information on soil parameters, such as organic carbon, pH, water storage capacity, soil depth, total exchangeable nutrients and salinity.</p>
          <p>Topsoil organic carbon (measured in tons per hectare) was calculated using inputs of percent carbon content, bulk density, and gravel volume. We use relative bulk density values except for Andosols and Histosols, which are typically overestimated by this method. Values are calculated for 0-30 cm depth. See more information on calculating SOC from the HWSD <a href="http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdb_archive/eusoils_docs/other/EUR25225.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></p>

Its spatial resolution is 0.6 miles (1 km) and was validated against data from a network of nearly 70 ground sites around the world. It was developed by a team of scientists from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California; the University of Maryland, College Park; and Woods Hole Research Center, Falmouth, Massachusetts. The map was created using 2.5 million carefully screened, globally distributed laser pulse measurements from space. The light detection and ranging (Lidar) data were collected in 2005 by the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System instrument on NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat).</p>
