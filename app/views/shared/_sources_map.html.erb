            <dd>The world IFL map was created through visual interpretation of Landsat images by experts. The map may contain inaccuracies due to limitations in the spatial resolution of the imagery and lack of ancillary information about local land-use practices in some regions. In addition, the methodology assumes that fires in proximity to roads or other infrastructure may have been caused by humans, and therefore constitute a form of anthropogenic disturbance. This assumption could result in an underestimation of IFL extent in the boreal biome.</dd>

          <p>The <a href='http://intactforests.org/' target='_blank'>Intact Forest Landscapes</a> (IFL) data set identifies unbroken expanses of natural ecosystems within the zone of forest extent that show no signs of significant human activity and are large enough that all native biodiversity, including viable populations of wide-ranging species, could be maintained. To map IFL areas, a set of criteria was developed and designed to be globally applicable and easily replicable, the latter to allow for repeated assessments over time as well as verification. IFL areas were defined as unfragmented landscapes, at least 50,000 hectares in size, and with a minimum width of 10 kilometers. IFL areas were defined as unfragmented landscapes, at least 50,000 hectares in size, and with a minimum width of 10 kilometers. These were then mapped from Landsat imagery for the years 2000 and 2013.</p>

          <p>Changes in the extent of IFLs were identified within year 2000 IFL boundary using the global wall-to-wall Landsat image composite for year 2013 and the global forest cover loss dataset (Hansen et al., 2013). Areas identified as “reduction in extent” met the IFL criteria in 2000, but no longer met the criteria in 2013. The main causes of change were clearing for agriculture and tree plantations, industrial activity such as logging and mining, fragmentation due to infrastructure and new roads, and fires assumed to be caused by humans.</p>

          <p>This data can be used to assess forest intactness, alteration, and degradation at global and regional scales. More information about the data set and methodology is available on  <a href="http://www.intactforests.org">www.intactforests.org</a></p>

          <p>This data set was created by Transparent World, with the support of Global Forest Watch. Many studies depicting forest cover and forest change cannot distinguish between natural forests and plantations. This data set attempts to distinguish tree plantations from natural forest for seven key countries: Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Indonesia, Liberia, Malaysia, and Peru.</p>

          <p>Given the variability of plantations and their spectral similarity to natural forests, this study used visual interpretations of satellite imagery, primarily <a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">Landsat</a>, supplemented by high resolution imagery (Google Maps, Bing Maps, or Digital Globe), where available, to locate plantations. Analysts hand-digitized plantation boundaries based on several key visual criteria, including texture, shape, color, and size.</p>

          <p>Each polygon is labelled with the plantation type and when possible, the species. A “gr” in front of the species name indicates a group of species, such as pines or fruit, where the individual species was not identifiable. The percentage of plantation coverage indicates a rough estimate of the prevalence of plantation within apolygon (as in the case of a mosaic). Types are defined as follows:</p>
          <p><ul class="bullets">
            <li><strong>Large industrial plantation:</strong> single plantation units larger than 100 hectares</li>
            <li><strong>Mosaic of medium-sized plantations:</strong> mosaic of plantation units < 100 hectares embedded within patches of other land use</li>
            <li><strong>Mosaic of small-sized plantations:</strong> mosaic of plantation units < 10 hectares embedded within patches of other land use.</li>
            <li><strong>Clearing/ very young plantation:</strong> bare ground with contextual clues suggesting it will become a plantations (shape or pattern of clearing, proximity to other plantations, distinctive road network, etc)</li>
          </ul></p>
